    ## Common Documentation Challenges  
    <Card>
      - **Time-Consuming**  
        Writing and maintaining docs manually takes hours away from coding.  
      - **Inconsistent Quality**  
        Documentation varies in clarity and completeness across teams.

        Docs often fall out of sync with the latest codebase updates.  
      - **Poor Developer Experience**  
        Hard-to-navigate or unclear docs frustrate developers and slow onboarding.  
      - **Lack of Collaboration**  
        Teams struggle to review, edit, and improve docs together.
